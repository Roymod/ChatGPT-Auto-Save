# Privacy Policy for ChatGPT Tools

**Last Updated:** [Juan 9 2026]

This Privacy Policy describes how **ChatGPT Tools** ("we", "us", or "our") collects, uses, and discloses information, and what choices you have with respect to the information.

## 1. Information We Collect

### A. User-Generated Content (Local)
Our extension allows you to export and backup your ChatGPT conversation history. This data is accessed directly from the web page you are visiting (chatgpt.com) and is processed locally within your browser to generate downloadable files (JSON, Markdown, HTML). **We do not collect, store, or transmit your conversation history to our own servers.**

### B. Input Data for AI Prediction
The extension features an "AI Autocomplete / Prediction" function. When this feature is enabled, the text you type into the input box and the immediate conversation context (last few messages) are sent to a third-party AI provider to generate text suggestions.

## 2. How We Use Your Information

*   **Export & Backup:** To format and save your data to your local device.
*   **Settings & Preferences:** We use Chrome's local storage (`chrome.storage.local`) to save your preferences (e.g., backup intervals, theme settings, API configurations).
*   **AI Features:** To provide smart text completion and next-response predictions.

## 3. Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party service to provide AI functionalities:

*   **DeepSeek API:**
    *   When the "AI Autocomplete" or "Prediction" feature is active, your input text and context are transmitted to DeepSeek API (`https://api.deepseek.com`) for processing.
    *   This data is used solely to generate the response and is not used by us for any other purpose.
    *   Please refer to DeepSeek's privacy policy for more information on how they handle data.

If you do not wish to send data to DeepSeek, you can disable the "AI Autocomplete" feature in the extension popup menu.

## 4. Data Security

*   **Local Processing:** The majority of the extension's operations (Export, UI Theming, Auto-Backup) occur entirely locally within your browser.

## 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
