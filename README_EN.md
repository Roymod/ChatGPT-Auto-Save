* **JSON** (compatible with the official format)
* **Markdown**
* **HTML**

### 🔄 Smart Auto Backup

* Customizable backup interval (**1 minute to 7 days**)
* Accurate scheduling:

### 📥 Experimental Import / Restore

* How it works:

### 🏢 ChatGPT Team Support

### 🛡️ Security & Protection

* Anti-accidental-close mechanism:

  * Optional “warn before closing page” to prevent interruptions during long responses or unsaved progress
* Local-first storage:

  * All progress, settings, and token handling are processed **locally in the browser**
  * **No data is uploaded to any server**

### 🎨 Immersive UI

* Popup panel with a glowing/animated background
